/**
 * Easy to use Http and Https client, that transparently adds gzip compression
 * and ignores all Https certificates. It can also be used for using credentials
 * in your connection.
 * 
 * This class was created for Android applications, where the appropriate apache libraries
 * are already available. If you are developing for another platform, make sure
 * to add the httpclient, httpcore and commons-logging libs to your buildpath. 
 * They can be downloaded from http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi
 * 
 *  <code><br/>
		EasyHttpClient client = new EasyHttpClient();<br/>
		System.out.println(client.get("https://encrypted.google.com/"));<br/>
